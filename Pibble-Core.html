        <h1 style="color: white;"> What is a pibble?</h1>
        <p style="color: white;"> Pibble is a short name for a pitbull, they are very cute when they're first born but look quite aggressive when they grow.<br>
        The name was given to them as a way of lessening the fear of the breed because of their reputation of being violent dogs. <br>
        From what I have seen of this breed they are <strong> the biggest softies</strong> you will ever meet. Alongside the name there is also a meme known as "pibble core".</p>

        <h3 style="color: white;">Pibble core and the good it has done</h3>
        <p style="color: white;"> "Pibble core" is a popular trend at the moment that centers around the pitbull breed specifically as puppies. They are extremely cute <br>
        and derpy looking at the same time. It shows a new side of the supposedly <em>vicious</em> breed and people can embrace them not as a <em>monster</em> but instead as what they are<br>
        <strong>a cute dog</strong>. I am not particulary versed in this topic as some are but what I have seen of it is very enjoyable. Pibble core is something you can annoy your friend with, <br>
        talk about when you're bored or simply just enjoy it as it is and indulge in these adorable puppies.</p>
